# HexletCode

Welcome my first gem. Form generator - DSL, with the help of which it is convenient to generate forms. This library takes on tasks that usually require writing a lot of boilerplate code, such as error handling. In the Rails world, Simple Form is used for this. Our generator is conceptually similar to it, but much simpler.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hexlet_code'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hexlet_code

## Usage


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
